        Run this command in your project's root folder and paste the result:

        ```sh
        npx envinfo --system --binaries --browsers --npmPackages "next,react,next-auth" && npx envinfo --npmPackages "@next-auth/*"
        ```
        Alternatively, if the above command did not work, we need the version of the following packages from your package.json: "next", "react", "next-auth" and your adapter. Please also mention your OS and Node.js version, as well as the browser you are using.
