## History

- NextAuth.js was originally developed by <a href="https://github.com/iaincollins">Iain Collins</a> in 2016 for Next.js.

- In 2020, NextAuth.js was rebuilt from the ground up to support Serverless, with support for MySQL, Postgres and MongoDB, JSON Web Tokens and built in support for over a dozen authentication providers.

- In 2021, efforts have started to move NextAuth.js to other frameworks and to support as many databases and providers as possible.
