We're creating internal guides to help understand how to use Auth.js and all the possible configurations and uses cases it supports.

If you can't find what you're looking for, [raise an issue](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/new/choose) then take a look at our third-party [community resources](/guides/resources).
