<Callout type="info">
  Auth.js is completely free and fully open-source. It is used in some of the
  biggest sites on the Internet [like
  ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/balazsorban44/status/1721632174279897132) with
  **more than 100 million users a week**!
</Callout>

Therefore, it is easy to forget that Auth.js is created and maintained by [actual humans](/contributors#core-team)! None of the individuals work on the project full-time, and they often dedicate their free time to support anyone from individuals to medium-size to billion-dollar companies.

It would not be possible without the generous support of our sponsors.
