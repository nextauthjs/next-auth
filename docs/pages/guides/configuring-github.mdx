# OAuth with GitHub

In this tutorial, we'll be setting up Auth.js in a Next.js application to be able to log in with **GitHub**.

<Callout type="info">
  This tutorial uses GitHub as the OAuth provider and Next.js as the framework.
  Note that for any OAuth provider or any framework, **the process will be the
  same/very similar**, mainly differing on how you register your application in
  the chosen provider's dashboard.
</Callout>

## Setting up Auth.js

### Installing Auth.js and Next.js

For this tutorial, we're gonna use the default [Auth.js & Next.js example app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example). If you already have an existing Next.js app, it should work too. If you don't, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example.git && cd next-auth-example
```

If you're using the example app, Auth.js is already installed, otherwise follow the [installation instructions](/getting-started/installation).

### Creating the server config

Next, we're gonna create the main Auth.js configuration file which contains the necessary configuration for Auth.js, as well as the dynamic route handler.

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github"

export const { handlers, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [GitHub],
})
```

```ts filename="./app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts"
import { handlers } from "@/auth" // Referring to the auth.ts we just created
export const { GET, POST } = handlers
export const runtime = "edge" // optional
```

Since this is a [catch-all dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments), it will respond to all the relevant Auth.js API routes so that your application can interact with the chosen OAuth provider using the [OAuth 2](https://oauth.net/2) protocol.

### Adding environment variables

If you haven't, create an `.env.local` file as explained in the [installation section](/getting-started/installation) and add the following two GitHub variables:

```bash filename=".env.local" {3-4}
AUTH_SECRET="changeMe"

AUTH_GITHUB_ID=
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=
```

We will be filling `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` and `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` with proper values from the GitHub Developer Portal once we have registered our application in GitHub.

## Registering your App

### Creating an OAuth App in GitHub

To get the required credentials from GitHub, we need to create an application in their developer settings.

Go to the [GitHub developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers), also found under **Settings** → **Developers** → **OAuth Apps**, and click "New OAuth App":

import CreatingOAuthApp from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/creating-oauth-app.webp"

<Screenshot src={CreatingOAuthApp} alt="Creating an OAuth App on GitHub" />

Next, you'll be presented with a screen to register your application. Fill in all the required fields.

import CallbackUrl from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/callback-url.webp"

<Screenshot src={CallbackUrl} />

The default callback URL should generally take the form of `[origin]/api/auth/callback/[provider]`, however, the default is slightly different depending on which framework you're using.

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```bash
// Local
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github

// Prod
https://app.company.com/api/auth/callback/github
```

</Code.Next>
<Code.Svelte>

```bash
// Local
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/github

// Prod
https://app.company.com/auth/callback/github
```

Notice no `/api` path parameter.

</Code.Svelte>
<Code.Express>

```bash
// Local
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/github

// Prod
https://app.company.com/auth/callback/github
```

Notice no `/api` path parameter.

</Code.Express>
</Code>

Once you've entered all the required fields, press **"Register application"**.

### Secrets

After successfully registering your application, GitHub will present us with the required details.

import ClientIdSecret from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/clientid-secret.webp"

<Screenshot src={ClientIdSecret} alt="Generating clientId and clientSecret" />

We need 2 things from this screen, the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

The Client ID is always visible, it is a public identifier of your OAuth application within GitHub.

To get a Client Secret, you have to click on **"Generate a new client secret"**, which will create your first client secret. You can easily create a new client secret here in case your first one gets leaked, lost, etc.

<Callout>
  Keep your **Client Secret** secure and never expose it to the public or share
  it with people outside your organization.
</Callout>

## Wiring all together

Now that we have the required Client ID and Client Secret, paste them into your `.env.local` file we created earlier.

```bash filename=".env.local" {3-4}
AUTH_SECRET="changeMe"

AUTH_GITHUB_ID={clientId}
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET={clientSecret}
```

With all the pieces in place, you can now start your local dev server and test the login process.

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You should see the following page:

import AppStart from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/app-start.webp"

<Screenshot src={AppStart} alt="App Start" />

Click on **"Sign in"**, you should be redirected to the default Auth.js signin page. You can [customize this page](/guides/pages/signin) to fit your needs. Next, click on **"Sign in with GitHub"**. Auth.js will redirect you to GitHub, where GitHub will recognize your application and ask the user to confirm they want to authenticate to your new application by entering their credentials.

import GitHubCredentials from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/github-auth-credentials.webp"

<Screenshot src={GitHubCredentials} alt="GitHub Credentials" />

Once authenticated, GitHub will redirect the user back to your app and Auth.js will take care of the rest:

import GitHubAuthSuccess from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/github-auth-success.webp"

<Screenshot src={GitHubAuthSuccess} alt="GitHub Authentication Success" />

If you've landed back here that means everything worked! We have completed the whole OAuth authentication flow so that users can log in to your application via GitHub!

<Callout type="info">
  As you can see, most of the time required setting up OAuth in your application
  is spent registering your application in the OAuth provider's dashboard (some
  are easier to navigate, some are harder). Once registered, the setup via
  Auth.js should be straight forward.
</Callout>

## Deployment

Before you can release your app to production, you'll need to change a few things.

Unfortunately, GitHub is among the providers which do not let you register multiple callback URLs for one application. Therefore, you'll need to register a separate application in GitHub's dashboard [as we did previously](/guides/configuring-github#registering-our-app) but set the callback URL to your application's production domain (.i.e `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/github`). You'll then also have a new **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that you need to add to your production environment via your hosting provider's dashboard (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, etc.) or however you manage environment variables in production.

Refer to the [Deployment page](/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
