# OAuth with GitHub

In this tutorial, we'll be setting up Auth.js in a Next.js application to be able to log in with **GitHub**.

<Callout type="info">
  This tutorial uses GitHub as the OAuth provider and Next.js as the framework. Note that for any OAuth
  provider or any framework, **the process will be the same/very similar**, mainly differing on how
  you register your application in the chosen provider's dashboard.
</Callout>

## Setting up Auth.js

### Installing Auth.js and Next.js

For this tutorial, we're gonna use the default [Auth.js & Next.js example app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example). If you already have an existing Next.js app, it should work too. If you haven't, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example.git && cd next-auth-example
```

If you're using the example app, Auth.js is already installed, otherwise follow the [installation instructions](/installation).

### Creating the server config

Next, we're gonna create the main Auth.js configuration file (which is a Next.js API route). This route contains the necessary configuration for Auth.js, as well as the dynamic route handler:

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github";
 
export const { handlers, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [GitHub],
});
```
```ts filename="app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts"
export { GET, POST } from "./auth";
export const runtime = "edge"; // optional
```

Behind the scenes, this creates all the relevant Auth.js API routes so that your application can interact with the chosen OAuth provider using the [OAuth 2](https://oauth.net/2) protocol.

### Adding environment variables

If you haven't, create an `.env.local` file as explained in the [installation section](/installation) and add the following two variables:

```bash filename=".env.local"
AUTH_GITHUB_ID="123"
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET="123"
```

We will be filling `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` and `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` with proper values from the GitHub Developer Portal once we have registered our application in GitHub.

## Registering our app

### Creating an OAuth app in GitHub

We need to register our application in GitHub, so that when Auth.js forwards the authorization requests to it, GitHub can recognize your application and authenticate the user for us.

Log in [to GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers), go to **Settings** → **Developers** → **OAuth Apps** and click "New OAuth App":

import CreatingOAuthApp from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/creating-oauth-app.webp"

<Screenshot src={CreatingOAuthApp} alt="Creating an OAuth App on GitHub" />

Next, you'll be presented with a screen to register your application. Fill in all the required fields:

import CallbackUrl from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/callback-url.webp"

<Screenshot src={CallbackUrl} />

<Callout type="info">
The callback URL we provide should have the following shape:

```
[origin]/api/auth/callback/[provider]
```

For us, given we want to try our authentication **working locally** on our machine and we're using **GitHub** as our authentication provider, it'll be:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
```

</Callout>

Note that, because we're using Next.js, when running the app locally it starts our server on port `3000` by default. Hence, the origin is `http://localhost:3000`.

The last part of the URL, `[provider]`, is the ID of the provider you're using. In this case, we're using GitHub, so it's `github`. If you're using Google, it'll be `google`. The ID of the provider is its name [in kebab case](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Kebab-case).

### Getting secrets

Once created, the next screen shows all the configurations for our app:

import ClientIdSecret from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/clientid-secret.webp"

<Screenshot src={ClientIdSecret} alt="Generating clientId and clientSecret" />

We need 2 things from this screen, the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

The Client ID is always there, a public identifier of your OAuth application within GitHub.

For the Client Secret, click on the "Generate a new client Secret" and you will be presented with a new string (which is just a randomized string).

<Callout>
  Keep both your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** secure and never expose
  them to the public or share them with people outside your organization.
</Callout>

We have finished configuring our OAuth provider, now let's wire all together so we can finally authenticate our users through GitHub.

## Wiring all together

Let's paste both the Client ID and Client Secret created in the previous section into our app's environment file:

```bash filename=".env.local"
AUTH_GITHUB_ID={clientId}
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET={clientSecret}
```

Finally, we're ready to run our application locally.

Start the Next.js app:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

And navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). You should see the following page:

import AppStart from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/app-start.webp"

<Screenshot src={AppStart} alt="App Start" />

Click on "Sign in" and then on "Sign in with GitHub".

Auth.js will redirect you to GitHub, and GitHub will recognize our app (that we just registered), asking the user to enter its credentials to proceed:

import GitHubCredentials from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/github-auth-credentials.webp"

<Screenshot src={GitHubCredentials} alt="GitHub Credentials" />

Once authenticated, GitHub will redirect the user back to our app and Auth.js will take care of the rest:

import GitHubAuthSuccess from "../../public/img/oauth-setup/github-auth-success.webp"

<Screenshot src={GitHubAuthSuccess} alt="GitHub Authentication Success" />

Great! We have completed the whole end-to-end authentication flow so that users can log in to our application via GitHub!

<Callout type="info">
  As you can see, most of the time required setting up OAuth in our application
  is spent registering our application in the OAuth provider's dashboard (some
  are easier to navigate, some are harder). Once registered, the setup via
  Auth.js is then really easy.
</Callout>

## Deployment

Before we can release our app to production, we'll need to change a few things.

You'll need to register a separate application in GitHub's dashboard [as we did here](/setup/oauth-authentication#registering-our-app-in-github) but setting up the Callback URL host to your application's domain (.i.e `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/github`). You'll then have a new **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that will be added via environment variables in your production environment.

Refer to the [Deployment page](/deployment) for more information.
