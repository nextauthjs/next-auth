# Custom sign out page

Is easy to configure Auth.js to display a custom sign out page in case you need it.

Here's the code for a simple sign out page built on top of the [example app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example):

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```tsx filename="app/auth-signout/page.tsx"
import { UserSwitch } from "@phosphor-icons/react/UserSwitch"
import { signOut } from "../../auth"
import { AuthError } from "next-auth"

export default function SignOutPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center w-full h-screen pt-32">
      <Card>
        <h5>
          <UserSwitch fontSize="2rem" />
          Are you sure you want to sign out?
        </h5>
        <form
          action={async (formData) => {
            "use server"
            await signOut()
          }}
        >
          <button type="submit">Sign out</button>
        </form>
      </Card>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Code.Next>
</Code>

Now if the user navigates to `/auth-signout` they'll see the following page:

import CustomSignOut from "../../../public/img/tutorials/custom-sign-out.webp"

<Screenshot src={CustomSignOut} alt="Custom Sign-out" />

If they click "Sign out", the session will be deleted and they will be redirected to the homepage (which is always `/` by default).
