# Upgrade Guide (NextAuth.js v5)

<Callout type="info">
  This guide only applies to `next-auth` upgrades for users of Next.js. Feel
  free to skip to the next section, [Installation](/overview/installation), if
  you are not upgrading to `next-auth@5`.
</Callout>

**NextAuth.js version 5** is a major rewrite of the `next-auth` package, but we introduced as few breaking changes as possible. For anything else,
we summed up the necessary changes in this guide.

<Callout type="info">
  This only applies to `next-auth` upgrades for users of Next.js
</Callout>

Get started by installing the latest version with the `latest` tag.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install next-auth@latest
```

## New Features

#### Main changes

- App Router-first (`pages/` still supported).
- OAuth support on preview deployments: [Read more](/getting-started/deployment#securing-a-preview-deployment).
- Simplified setup (shared config, inferred [env variables](/reference/nextjs#environment-variable-inferrence)).
- Edge-compatible
- There is a new `account()` callback on providers which allows you to pass in data from the
  provider to save, see [`account()` docs](/reference/core/providers#account).

#### Universal `auth()`

- Remember a single method, and authenticate anywhere
- Use `auth()` instead of `getServerSession`, `getSession`, `withAuth`, `getToken`, and `useSession`. [Read more](#authenticating-server-side).

## Breaking Changes

- Auth.js now builds on `@auth/core` with stricter [OAuth](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6749.html)/[OIDC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) spec-compliance, which might break some existing OAuth providers. See our [open issues](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproviders) for more details.
- OAuth 1.0 support is deprecated.
- The minimum required Next.js version is now [14.0](https://nextjs.org/14).
- The import `next-auth/next` is replaced. See [Authenticating server-side](#authenticating-server-side) for more details.
- The import `next-auth/middleware` is replaced. See [Authenticating server-side](#authenticating-server-side) for more details.

## Migration

<Steps>

### Configuration File

We worked hard to avoid saving your config options in a separate file and then passing them around as `authOptions` throughout your application. To achieve this, we settled on moving the configuration file to the root of the repository and having it export the necessary functions you can use everywhere else. (`auth`, `signIn`, `signOut`, `handlers` etc.).

An example of the new configuration file format is as follows, which should look very similar to the one you are used to from v4.

```ts filename="./auth.ts" {5}
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github"
import Google from "next-auth/providers/google"

export const { auth, handlers, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [GitHub, Google],
})
```

Some things to note about the new configuration:

1. This is now in a file named `auth.ts` in the root of your repository. It can technically be named anything, but you'll be importing the exported methods from here across your app, so we'd recommend keeping it short.
2. There is no need to install `@auth/core` to import the provider definitions from, these come from `next-auth` itself.
3. The configuration object passed to the `NextAuth()` function is the same as before.
4. The methods exported from that `NextAuth()` function call are new and will be required elsewhere in your application.

This then allows you to import the functions exported from this file elsewhere in your codebase via import statements like the following.

```ts
import { auth } from "@/auth"
```

The old configuration file, contained in the API Route (`pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`), now becomes a short Route Handler for `GET` and `POST` requests for those paths. This file now lives in the App Router, but the rest of your app can stay in the Pages Router if you are gradually migrating!

```ts filename="app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts"
import { handlers } from "@/auth";
export const { GET, POST } = handlers`;
```

## Authenticating server-side

Auth.js has had a few different ways to authenticate server-side in the past, and we've tried to simplify this as much as possible.

Now that Next.js components are **server-first** by default, and thanks to the investment in using standard Web APIs, we were able to simplify the authentication process to a single `auth()` function that you can use anywhere.

See the table below for a summary of the changes. Below that are diff examples of how to use the new `auth()` method in various environments and contexts.

### Authentication methods

<Tabs.Tab>

Instead of importing `getServerSession` from `next-auth/next` or `getToken` from `next-auth/jwt`, you can now import the `auth` function from your config file and call it without passing `authOptions`.

```diff filename='pages/api/example.ts'
- import { getServerSession } from "next-auth/next"
- import { getToken } from "next-auth/jwt"
- import { authOptions } from 'pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]'
+ import { auth } from "@/auth"
+ import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next"

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
-  const session = await getServerSession(req, res, authOptions)
-  const token = await getToken({ req })
+  const session = await auth(req, res)
  if (session) return res.json('Success')
  return res.status(401).json("You must be logged in.");
}
```

<Callout>
  Whenever `auth()` is passed the res object, it will rotate the session expiry.
  This was not the case with `getToken()` previously. The default session expiry
  is 30 days, but you can change it by setting `authOptions.session.maxAge`.
</Callout>

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

Instead of importing `getServerSession` from `next-auth/next` or `getToken` from `next-auth/jwt`, you can now import the `auth` function from your config file and call it without passing `authOptions`.

```diff filename="pages/protected.tsx"
- import { getServerSession } from "next-auth/next"
- import { getToken } from "next-auth/jwt"
- import { authOptions } from 'pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]'
+ import { auth } from "@/auth"

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (context) => {
-  const session = await getServerSession(context.req, context.res, authOptions)
-  const token = await getToken({ req: context.req })
+  const session = await auth(context)
  if (session) // Do something with the session

  return { props: { session } }
}
```

<Callout>
  Whenever `auth()` is passed the res object, it will rotate the session expiry.
  This was not the case with `getToken()` previously.
</Callout>

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

```diff filename='middleware.ts'
- export { default } from 'next-auth/middleware'
+ export { auth as default } from "./auth"
```

For advanced use cases, you can use `auth` as a wrapper for your Middleware:

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { auth } from "./auth"

export default auth((req) => {
  // req.auth
})

// Optionally, don't invoke Middleware on some paths
export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)"],
}
```

Read the [Middleware docs](/reference/nextjs#in-middleware) for more details.

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

Auth.js v4 has supported reading the session in Server Components for a while via `getServerSession`. This has been also simplified to the same `auth()` function.

```diff filename="app/page.tsx"
- import { authOptions } from 'pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]'
- import { getServerSession } from "next-auth/next"
+ import { auth } from "@/auth"

export default async function Page() {
-  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)
+  const session = await auth()
  return (<p>Welcome {session?.user.name}!</p>)
}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

Imports from `next-auth/react` are now marked with the `"use client"` directive. [Read
more](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#the-use-client-directive).

If you have previously used `getSession()` or other imports server-side, you'll have to change it to use the [`auth()`](/reference/nextjs#auth) method instead.

</Tabs.Tab>

## Adapters

### Adapter packages

Beginning with `next-auth` v5, you should now install database adapters from the `@auth/*-adapter` scope, instead of `@next-auth/*-adapter`. Database adapters don't rely on any Next.js features, so it made more sense to move them to this new scope.

```diff
- npm install @next-auth/prisma-adapter
+ npm install @auth/prisma-adapter
```

<Callout type="info">
  Check out the [adapters page](/getting-started/database) for a list of
  official adapters, or the "[create a database
  adapter](/guides/creating-a-database-adapter)" guide to learn how to create
  your own.
</Callout>

### Database Migrations

NextAuth.js v5 **does not introduce any breaking changes to the database schema**. However, since OAuth 1.0 support is dropped, the already optional `oauth_token_secret` and `oauth_token` fields can be removed from the `account` table if you are not using them.

Furthermore, previously uncommon fields like GitHub's `refresh_token_expires_in` fields were
required to be added to the `account` table. This is no longer the case, and you can remove it if
you are not using it. If you do use it, please make sure to return it via the new [`account()` callback](/reference/core/providers#account).

### Edge compatibility

While Auth.js strictly uses standard [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) (and thus can run in any environment which supports them), some libraries or ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) packages that you rely on might not be ready yet. In this case, you can split the auth configuration into multiple files. The following is an example of how to do this with a database adapter.

Auth.js supports two [session strategies](/concepts/session-strategies). When you are using an adapter, you can choose to save the session data into a database. **Unless your database and its adapter is compatible with the Edge runtime/infrastructure, you will not be able to use a `"database"` session strategy**.

If you are using an adapter which relies on an ORM/library that is not yet compatible with Edge runtime(s) here is an example of how you might work around that, by forcing the 'jwt' strategy.

<Callout>
  The following filenames are only a convention we chose, the
  filenames/structure can be anything you like.
</Callout>

1. Create an `auth.config.ts` file which exports an object containing your Auth.js configuration options. You can put all common configuration here that does not rely on the adapter.

```ts filename="auth.config.ts" {3}
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github"
import type { NextAuthConfig } from "next-auth"
export default { providers: [GitHub] } satisfies NextAuthConfig
```

2. Next, create an `auth.ts` file and add your adapter and the `jwt` session strategy there. This is the `auth.ts` configuration file you will import from in the rest of your application, other than in the middleware.

```ts filename="auth.ts" {9-10}
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import { PrismaAdapter } from "@auth/prisma-adapter"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"
import authConfig from "./auth.config"

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

export const { handlers, auth } = NextAuth({
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  session: { strategy: "jwt" },
  ...authConfig,
})
```

3. In your middleware file, import the configuration object from your first `auth.config.ts` file and use it to [lazily initialize]() Auth.js there. In effect, initializing Auth.js separately without the non-edge compatible adapter.

```ts filename="middleware.ts" {1}
import authConfig from "./auth.config"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
export const { auth: middleware } = NextAuth(authConfig)
```

That's it! Now you can keep using a database for user data, even if your adapter is not compatible with the Edge runtime yet.

Please follow up with your database/ORM's maintainer to see if they are planning to support the Edge runtime/infrastructure.

## Environment Variables

There are **no breaking changes to the environment variables**, but we have cleaned up a few things which make some of them unnecessary. Therefore, we wanted to share some best practices around which environment variables are necessary, which are not, and how best to use them.

- If you name your provider secret / clientId variables following this syntax, `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` + `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`, they'll be auto-detected and you won't have to explicitly pass them into your provider's configuration in the providers array.
- The `NEXTAUTH_URL`/`AUTH_URL` is not necessary anymore in most environments. We will auto-detect the host based on the request headers.
- The `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` environment variable serves the same purpose as setting `trustHost: true` option in your Auth.js configuration. This is necessary when running Auth.js behind a proxy. When set to true we will trust the `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers to determine the host URL.
- The `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable is the only variable that is really necessary anymore. You do not need to additionally pass this value into your config as the `secret` configuration option if you've set the environment variable.

## TypeScript

- `NextAuthOptions` is renamed to `NextAuthConfig`
- The following types are now exported from `next-auth` (as well as `@auth/sveltekit`, for example):

```ts
export type {
  Account,
  DefaultSession,
  Profile,
  Session,
  User,
} from "@auth/core/types"
```

- In addition, all `Adapter` types are re-exported from `next-auth/adapters` (as well as `@auth/sveltekit/adapters`, for example).

</Steps>
