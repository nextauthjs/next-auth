<Steps>
### Installing Auth.js

Start by installing the appropriate package for your framework:

<Code>
  <Code.Next>
    
    ```bash npm2yarn
    npm install next-auth
    ```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>
  
    ```bash npm2yarn
    npm install @auth/sveltekit
    ```
  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>
  
    ```bash npm2yarn
    npm install @auth/express
    ```
  
  </Code.Express>
</Code>

<Callout type="info">Installing `@auth/core` is not necessary.</Callout>

### Setup Environment

The only environment variable that is mandatory is the `AUTH_SECRET`. This is a random value used by the library to encrypt tokens and email
verification hashes. (See [Deployment](/getting-started/deployment) to learn more). You can generate one via running:

```bash
npx auth secret
```

Alternatively, you can use the `openssl` CLI, `openssl rand -base64 33`.

Then add it to your `.env.local` file:

```bash filename=".env.local"
AUTH_SECRET=secret
```

### Configure

Next, create the Auth.js config object. This is where you can control the behaviour of the library and specify custom authentication logic, adapters, etc. As of version 5, we recommend all frameworks to create an `auth.ts` file in the root of your project. In this file we'll pass in all the normal options to the framework specific initalization function and then export the route handler(s), signin and signout methods, and more.

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

Start by creating a new `auth.ts` file at the root of your app with the following content:

<Callout type="info">
  You can name this file whatever you want and place it wherever you like.
  However, we recommend this structure as we'll be using its 3 main exports:
  `signIn`, `signOut` and `auth` throughout the application.
</Callout>

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"

export const { signIn, signOut, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [],
})
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

First, setup a basic `SvelteKitAuth` configuration in `src/auth.ts`.

```ts filename="./src/auth.ts"
import { SvelteKitAuth } from "@auth/sveltekit"

export const { handle } = SvelteKitAuth({
  providers: [],
})
```

Next, we'll re-export that `handle` method in SvelteKit's `src/hooks.server.ts`.

```ts filename="./src/hooks.server.ts"
export { handle } from "./auth"
```

Finally, we can add the session to our `$page` store in the `+layout.server.ts` file(s).

```ts filename="./src/routes/+layout.server.ts" {5}
import type { LayoutServerLoad } from "./$types"

export const load: LayoutServerLoad = async (event) => {
  const session = await event.locals.auth()

  return {
    session,
  }
}
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="./src/routes/auth.route.ts"
import { ExpressAuth } from "@auth/express"
import express from "express"

const app = express()

// If app is served through a proxy, trust the proxy to allow HTTPS protocol to be detected
app.use("trust proxy")
app.use("/auth/*", ExpressAuth({ providers: [] }))
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

### Setup Authentication Methods

With that, the basic setup is complete! Next we'll setup the first authentication methods and fill out that `providers` array.
