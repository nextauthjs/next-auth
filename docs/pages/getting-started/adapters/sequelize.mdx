# Sequelize Adapter

## Resources

- [Sequelize documentation](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/)
- [Connecting to a Database](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html#connecting-to-a-database)

## Setup

### Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @auth/sequelize-adapter sequelize
```

### Environment Variables

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:adminadmin@0.0.0.0:5432/db
```

### Configuration

<Callout type="warning">
  You'll also have to manually install [the driver for your
  database](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html) of choice.
</Callout>

<Code>
<Code.Next>

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import SequelizeAdapter from "@auth/sequelize-adapter"
import { Sequelize } from "sequelize"

const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL)

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [],
  adapter: SequelizeAdapter(sequelize),
})
```

</Code.Next>
<Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="./src/auth.ts"
import { SvelteKitAuth } from "@auth/sveltekit"
import SequelizeAdapter from "@auth/sequelize-adapter"
import { Sequelize } from "sequelize"

const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL)

export const { handle, signIn, signOut } = SvelteKitAuth({
  providers: [],
  adapter: SequelizeAdapter(sequelize),
})
```

</Code.Svelte>
<Code.Express>

```ts filename="./src/routes/auth.route.ts"
import { ExpressAuth } from "@auth/express"
import SequelizeAdapter from "@auth/sequelize-adapter"
import { Sequelize } from "sequelize"

const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE_URL)

const app = express()

app.set("trust proxy", true)
app.use(
  "/auth/*",
  ExpressAuth({
    providers: [],
    adapter: SequelizeAdapter(sequelize),
  })
)
```

</Code.Express>
</Code>

### Schema

By default, the sequelize adapter will not create tables in your database. In production, best practice is to create the [required tables](/concepts/database-models) in your database via [migrations](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html). In development, you are able to call [`sequelize.sync()`](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html#model-synchronization) to have sequelize create the necessary tables, foreign keys and indexes:

> This schema is adapted for use in Sequelize and based upon our main
> [schema](/concepts/database-models)

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import SequelizeAdapter from "@auth/sequelize-adapter"
import Sequelize from "sequelize"

const sequelize = new Sequelize("sqlite::memory:")
const adapter = SequelizeAdapter(sequelize)

// Calling sync() is not recommended in production
sequelize.sync()

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  adapter,
})
```

## Advanced usage

### Using custom models

Sequelize models are option to customization like so:

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import SequelizeAdapter, { models } from "@auth/sequelize-adapter"
import Sequelize, { DataTypes } from "sequelize"

const sequelize = new Sequelize("sqlite::memory:")

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  // https://authjs.dev/reference/providers/
  providers: [],
  adapter: SequelizeAdapter(sequelize, {
    models: {
      User: sequelize.define("user", {
        ...models.User,
        phoneNumber: DataTypes.STRING,
      }),
    },
  }),
})
```
