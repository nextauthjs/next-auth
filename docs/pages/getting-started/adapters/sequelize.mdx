# Sequelize Adapter

## Resources

- [Sequelize Docs](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/)

## Setup

### Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install next-auth @auth/sequelize-adapter sequelize
```

<Callout type="warning">
  You'll also have to manually install [the driver for your
  database](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html) of choice.
</Callout>

### Configuring Auth.js

Add this adapter to your `./auth.js` Auth.js configuration file.

```js filename="./auth.js"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import SequelizeAdapter from "@auth/sequelize-adapter"
import { Sequelize } from "sequelize"

// https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html#connecting-to-a-database
const sequelize = new Sequelize("yourconnectionstring")

// For more information on each option (and a full list of options) go to
// https://authjs.dev/reference/core#authconfig
export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  // https://authjs.dev/reference/providers/
  providers: [],
  adapter: SequelizeAdapter(sequelize),
})
```

### Schema

By default, the sequelize adapter will not create tables in your database. In production, best practice is to create the [required tables](https://authjs.dev/reference/core/adapters/models) in your database via [migrations](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html). In development, you are able to call [`sequelize.sync()`](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html#model-synchronization) to have sequelize create the necessary tables, foreign keys and indexes:

> This schema is adapted for use in Sequelize and based upon our main
> [schema](https://authjs.dev/docs/database)

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import SequelizeAdapter from "@auth/sequelize-adapter"
import Sequelize from "sequelize"

const sequelize = new Sequelize("sqlite::memory:")
const adapter = SequelizeAdapter(sequelize)

// Calling sync() is not recommended in production
sequelize.sync()

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  adapter,
})
```

## Advanced usage

### Using custom models

Sequelize models are option to customization like so:

```ts filename="./auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import SequelizeAdapter, { models } from "@auth/sequelize-adapter"
import Sequelize, { DataTypes } from "sequelize"

const sequelize = new Sequelize("sqlite::memory:")

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  // https://authjs.dev/reference/providers/
  providers: [],
  adapter: SequelizeAdapter(sequelize, {
    models: {
      User: sequelize.define("user", {
        ...models.User,
        phoneNumber: DataTypes.STRING,
      }),
    },
  }),
})
```
