## Setup

### Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install pouchdb pouchdb-find @auth/pouchdb-adapter
```

<Callout>
  Depending on your architecture you can use PouchDB's http adapter to reach any
  database compliant with the CouchDB protocol (CouchDB, Cloudant, etc.) or use
  any other PouchDB compatible adapter (leveldb, in-memory, etc.)
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Your PouchDB instance MUST provide the `pouchdb-find` plugin since it is used
  internally by the adapter to build and manage indexes
</Callout>

Add this adapter to your `auth.js` next-auth configuration file.

```js filename="./auth.js"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import Google from "next-auth/providers/google"
import { PouchDBAdapter } from "@auth/pouchdb-adapter"
import PouchDB from "pouchdb"

// Setup your PouchDB instance and database
PouchDB.plugin(require("pouchdb-adapter-leveldb")) // Or any other adapter
  .plugin(require("pouchdb-find")) // Don't forget the `pouchdb-find` plugin

const pouchdb = new PouchDB("auth_db", { adapter: "leveldb" })

// For more information on each option (and a full list of options) go to
// https://authjs.dev/reference/configuration/auth-options
export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  // https://authjs.dev/reference/providers/
  providers: [
    Google({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
  adapter: PouchDBAdapter(pouchdb),
})
```

### Advanced usage

#### Memory-First Caching Strategy

If you need to boost your authentication layer performance, you may use PouchDB's powerful sync features and various adapters, to build a memory-first caching strategy.

Use an in-memory PouchDB as your main authentication database, and synchronize it with any other persisted PouchDB. You may do a one way, one-off replication at startup from the persisted PouchDB into the in-memory PouchDB, then two-way, continuous sync.

This will most likely not increase performance much in a serverless environment due to various reasons such as concurrency, function startup time increases, etc.
