# Cloudflare D1 Adapter

<Callout type="warning">
  This adapter is not developed or maintained by Cloudflare and they haven't
  declared the D1 API stable. The author will make an effort to keep this
  adapter up to date. The adapter is compatible with the D1 API as of March 22,
  2023.
</Callout>

## Resources

- [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)

## Setup

### Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install next-auth @auth/d1-adapter
```

This is the D1 Adapter for [`next-auth`](https://authjs.dev). This package can only be used in
conjunction with the Auth.js client packages, like `next-auth` and `@auth/sveltekit`. It is not a standalone package.

### Configure Auth.js

```js filename="./auth.js"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import { D1Adapter, up } from "@auth/d1-adapter"

// For more information on each option (and a full list of options) go to
// https://authjs.dev/reference/configuration/auth-options
export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  // https://authjs.dev/reference/providers/
  providers: [],
  adapter: D1Adapter(env.db),
})
```

### Migrations

Somewhere in the initialization of your application you need to run the `up(env.db)` function to create the tables in D1.
It will create 4 tables if they don't already exist:
`accounts`, `sessions`, `users`, `verification_tokens`.

The table prefix "" is not configurable at this time.

You can use something like the following to attempt the migration once each time your worker starts up. Running migrations more than once will not erase your existing tables.

```javascript
import { up } from "@auth/d1-adapter"

let migrated = false
async function migrationHandle({ event, resolve }) {
  if (!migrated) {
    try {
      await up(event.platform.env.db)
      migrated = true
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e.cause.message, e.message)
    }
  }
  return resolve(event)
}
```

- You can also initialize your tables manually. Look in [migrations.ts](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/adapter-d1/src/migrations.ts) for the relevant sql.
- Paste and execute the SQL from within your D1 database's console in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/d1).
