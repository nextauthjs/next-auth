# What is Auth.js?

Auth.js is a <abbr title="Designed to work seamlessly across different JavaScript runtime environments without relying on specific features or behaviors of any particular runtime">runtime agnostic</abbr> library based on standard Web APIs that integrates deeply with multiple modern JavaScript frameworks to provide an authentication experience that's simple to get started with, easy to extend, and always private and secure!

This documentation covers `next-auth@5.0.0-beta` and later and all other frameworks under the `@auth/*` namespace. Documentation for `next-auth@4.x.y` can still be found at [next-auth.js.org](https://next-auth.js.org).

Check the [supported integrations](#integrations) bellow for all supported packages. We are working on supporting more frameworks, but you can create your own or
help us create one for your favorite framework.

<Callout type="info">
  To reduce migration overhead, NextAuth.js for Next.js will continue to be
  released under the `next-auth` package name, instead of the `@auth/*`
  convention. Auth.js was born out of `next-auth` but [over the years has
  evolved](/contributors#history) to be framework agnostic.

Confused about Auth.js and NextAuth.js? Have a look at [our
history](/contributors#history).

## Integrations

Here are the state of planned and released integrations under the `@auth/*` and `@next-auth/*` scope, as well as `next-auth`. It also includes community created and maintained integrations. Integrations listed as "Planned" are something we'd love help with! See the [help needed](#help-needed) section below.

<Callout>
  Is your framework not supported? You can easily contribute by creating a
  framework integration by [following this
  guide](/guides/creating-a-framework-integration).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Note that because of preventing breaking changes on package imports,
  `next-auth` is the only framework package which is not named following the
  `@auth/*` convention. This library initially was born as `next-auth` but [over
  the years has evolved](/contributors#history) to be framework agnostic.
</Callout>

Framework and database integrations are all based on the [Auth.js Core library](/reference/core). In most cases, you will not interact with this package directly, as it is intended for library authors.

### Community Integrations

The community has published some great integrations / client packages for various frameworks and
libraries. We'd love to make some packages official in the future, if you're responsible for any of
them and are interested in collaborating, please do not hesitate to reach out!

### Help needed

In case you are a maintainer of a package that uses `@auth/core`, feel free to [reach out to
Bal√°zs](https://twitter.com/balazsorban44) or [info@authjs.dev](mailto:info@authjs.dev), if you want to collaborate on making it an official package, maintained in our repository. If you are interested in bringing `@auth/core` support to your favorite framework, we would love to hear from you!
