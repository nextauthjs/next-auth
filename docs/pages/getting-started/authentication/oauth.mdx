# OAuth

Auth.js comes with over 80 providers preconfigured. We constantly test ~20 of the most popular ones, by having them enabled and actively used in our [example application](https://next-auth-example.vercel.app). You can choose a provider below to get a walk-through, or find your provider of choice in the sidebar for further details.
