# Credentials Provider

The Credentials provider allows you to handle signing in with arbitrary credentials, such as a username and password, domain, two factor authentication or hardware device (e.g. YubiKey U2F / FIDO).

It is intended to support use cases where you have an existing system you need to authenticate users against, and therefore users authenticated in this manner are not persisted in the database.

<Callout type="warning">
OAuth providers spend significant amounts of money, time, and engineering effort to build:

- abuse detection (bot-protection, rate-limiting)
- password management (password reset, credential stuffing, rotation)
- data security (encryption/salting, strength validation)

and much more for authentication solutions. It is likely that your application would benefit from leveraging these battle-tested solutions rather than try to rebuild them from scratch.

If you'd still like to build password-based authentication for your application despite these risks, Auth.js gives you full control to do so.

<Callout type="warning">
  There is no validation on the user inputs by default. We recommend validating
  user input at runtime using a library like [Zod](https://zod.dev) or
  [Valibot](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot).

## Configuration

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import Credentials from "next-auth/providers/credentials"

export const { signIn, signOut, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Credentials({
      credentials: {
        username: { label: "Username" },
        password: { label: "Password", type: "password" },
      },
      async authorize({ request }) {
        const response = await fetch(request)
        if (!response.ok) return null
        return (await response.json()) ?? null
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="/src/auth.ts"
import SvelteKitAuth from "@auth/sveltekit"
import Credentials from "@auth/sveltekit/providers/credentials"

export const { handle, signIn, signOut } = SvelteKitAuth({
  providers: [
    Credentials({
      credentials: {
        username: { label: "Username" },
        password: { label: "Password", type: "password" },
      },
      async authorize({ request }) {
        const response = await fetch(request)
        if (!response.ok) return null
        return (await response.json()) ?? null
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="/src/app.ts"
import ExpressAuth from "@auth/express";
import Credentials from "@auth/express/providers/credentials";

app.use("/auth/*", ExpressAuth({
  providers: [
    Credentials({
      credentials: {
        username: { label: "Username" },
        password: { label: "Password", type: "password" },
      },
      async authorize({ request }) {
        const response = await fetch(request);
        if (!response.ok) return null;
        return (await response.json()) ?? null;
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

See the [callbacks documentation](/reference/core#authconfig#callbacks) for more information on how to interact with the token. For example, you can add additional information to the token by returning an object from the `jwt()` callback:

```js
callbacks: {
  async jwt({ token, user, account, profile, isNewUser }) {
    if (user) {
      token.id = user.id
    }
    return token
  }
}
```
