# Osso Provider

## Setup

### Callback URL

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

```bash
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/osso
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

```bash
https://example.com/auth/callback/osso
```

  </Code.Svelte>
</Code>

### Environment Variables

```
AUTH_OSSO_ID
AUTH_OSSO_SECRET
AUTH_OSSO_ISSUER
```

> Next.js and SvelteKit will automatically pick them up if named exactly this way, simplifying
> setup, if you'd like to name them something else you must pass them in in your providers array.

### Configuration

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import Osso from "next-auth/providers/osso"

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [Osso],
})
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="/src/auth.ts"
import SvelteKitAuth from "@auth/sveltekit"
import Osso from "@auth/sveltekit/providers/osso"

export const { handle, signIn, signOut } = SvelteKitAuth({
  providers: [Osso],
})
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="/src/app.ts"
import ExpressAuth from "@auth/express"
import Osso from "@auth/express/providers/osso"

app.use("/auth/*", ExpressAuth({ providers: [Osso] }))
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

### Resources

Osso is an open source service that handles SAML authentication against Identity Providers, normalizes profiles, and makes those profiles available to you in an OAuth 2.0 code grant flow.

- If you don't yet have an Osso instance, you can use [Osso's Demo App](https://demo.ossoapp.com) for your testing purposes. For documentation on deploying an Osso instance, see https://ossoapp.com/docs/deploy/overview/
- [Osso OAuth documentation](https://ossoapp.com/)

You can configure your OAuth Clients on your Osso Admin UI, i.e. https://demo.ossoapp.com/admin/config - you'll need to get a Client ID and Secret and allow-list your redirect URIs.
[SAML SSO differs a bit from OAuth](https://ossoapp.com/blog/saml-vs-oauth) - for every tenant who wants to sign in to your application using SAML, you and your customer need to perform a multi-step configuration in Osso's Admin UI and the admin dashboard of the tenant's Identity Provider. Osso provides documentation for providers like Okta and Osso, cloud-based IDPs who also offer a developer account that's useful for testing. Osso also provides a [Mock IDP](https://idp.ossoapp.com) that you can use for testing without needing to sign up for an Identity Provider service.

See Osso's complete configuration and testing documentation at https://ossoapp.com/docs/configure/overview

### Notes

By default, Auth.js assumes that the Osso provider is
based on the [OAuth 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) specification.

<Callout>

`issuer` should be the fully qualified domain – e.g. `demo.ossoapp.com`

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

The Osso provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/osso.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

</Callout>

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
