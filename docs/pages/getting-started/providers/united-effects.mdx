# United Effects Provider

## Setup

### Callback URL

```
https://example.com/api/auth/callback/united-effects
```

### Environment Variables

```
AUTH_UNITEDEFFECTS_ID
AUTH_UNITEDEFFECTS_SECRET
```

> Next.js and SvelteKit will automatically pick them up if named exactly this way, simplifying
> setup, if you'd like to name them something else you must pass them in in your providers array.

### Configuration

<Code>
  <Code.Next>

```ts filename="/auth.ts"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import UnitedEffects from "next-auth/providers/united-effects"

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [UnitedEffects],
})
```

  </Code.Next>
  <Code.Svelte>

```ts filename="/src/auth.ts"
import SvelteKitAuth from "@auth/sveltekit"
import UnitedEffects from "@auth/sveltekit/providers/united-effects"

export const { handle, signIn, signOut } = SvelteKitAuth({
  providers: [UnitedEffects],
})
```

  </Code.Svelte>
  <Code.Express>

```ts filename="/src/app.ts"
import ExpressAuth from "@auth/express"
import UnitedEffects from "@auth/express/providers/united-effects"

app.use("/auth/*", ExpressAuth({ providers: [UnitedEffects] }))
```

  </Code.Express>
</Code>

### Resources

- [UnitedEffects Auth.js documentation](https://docs.unitedeffects.com/integrations/nextauthjs)",

### Notes

By default, Auth.js assumes that the UnitedEffects provider is
based on the [Open ID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) specification.

<Callout>

`issuer` should be the fully qualified URL including your Auth Group ID – e.g. `https://auth.unitedeffects.com/YQpbQV5dbW-224dCovz-3`

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">

The United Effects API does not return the user name or image by design, so this provider will return null for both. United Effects prioritizes user personal information security above all and has built a secured profile access request system separate from the provider API.

</Callout>

The UnitedEffects provider comes with a [default configuration](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/united-effects.ts).
To override the defaults for your use case, check out [customizing a built-in OAuth provider](https://authjs.dev/guides/providers/custom-provider#override-default-options).

If you think you found a bug in the default configuration, you can [open an issue](https://authjs.dev/new/provider-issue).

Auth.js strictly adheres to the specification and it cannot take responsibility for any deviation from
the spec by the provider. You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,
we might not pursue a resolution. You can ask for more help in [Discussions](https://authjs.dev/new/github-discussions).
